# GEO IP Data Folder

This folder is supposed to contain the file `GeoIPCity.dat` which you must purchase the license and download from: [maxmind](http://www.maxmind.com/en/city)
once you put it here, you can use the GEOIP functions inside of `framework/handy/functions.py`.

You can also change the path to the`GeoIPCity.dat` file in the setting `settings.GEO_IP_FILE_LOCATION` which must be string with the path to the file (preferably, absolute)
